#**DimensionsTagUtility:**
------------------
A multi-platform utility for converting LEGO toy tag's hex data.

## Disclaimer:
This project was started purely as a "proof of concept", and is in no way endorsed, sponsored or affiliated with the LEGO group.
I am building this project for personal use and, above all else, as a learning tool. The designs are aimed at what I wanted to achieve, thus may not work for everyone. 
Use at your own risk.

## Use:
Enter the uuid from a blank tag, then search for the desired tag to display the converted hex data.

Thanks to Ellerbach's dimensions project for a lot of the logic and inspiration.
